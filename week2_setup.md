## Setup

This section documents the setup for Software Engineering work including the installation of Git, and Visual Studio, as well as personal decisions in regards to my set up.  
Our group specification mentioned the newest version of Visual Studio (2022) Community Edition - Community Edition is the version available for free so naturally thats the one we use.

# Getting Started

I downloaded the installer for Visual Studio (2022) from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ and let it start installing the dependencies and once it entered the selection menu I made sure to include the .net package to make sure I can make use of them later and C# will also be used for the majority of code.

After the installation is complete its time to personalize a little as well as prepare for project work. I decided to save some time by preconfiguring Visual Studio by setting my development settings to C#.

# Connecting to Github

I started by cloning the group repository from the start-up menu so that I have a way to contribute with the group on the project prepared for the future. The group provided a guide on how to better customise your git within Visual Studio but I decided against any changes and I had already implemented my git account details into Visual Studio.  
I also personally decided to get the CSharpier extension from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csharpier.CSharpier&ssr=false#overview which will help auto-format my code.  
This improves the quality and ensures that code is easier to understand for fellow team members.

# Checking for Maui

This should have prepared me for collarborating now. But I still need to check .NET MAUI is installed and working correctly.  
I discovered I installed the wrong .net configurations when I started visual studio so I went back to the installer and modified my installation with the correct one.  
I also didnt have enough storage space on my C drive and had to delete some leftover files.

After checking that Maui templates show up in Visual Studio and running the commands given to ensure Maui is installed, that should be the setup phase done!

# Side-note on Git

Since I already had Git but wanted to ensure I was using an up-to-date version with the rest of the group I redownloaded the installer from https://git-scm.com/download/win which automatically uninstalled my prexisting version and installed the newest one. Git has no install options for me to customise so it went as far as that.
