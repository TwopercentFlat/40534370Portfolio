# Setup

This section documents the setup for Software Engineering work including the installation of Git, and Visual Studio, as well as personal decisions in regards to my set up.
Our group specification mentioned the newest version of Visual Studio (2022) Community Edition - Community Edition is the version available for free so naturally thats the one we use.

I downloaded the installer for Visual Studio (2022) from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ and let it start installing the dependencies and once it entered the selection menu I made sure to include the .net package to make sure I can make use of them later and C# will also be used for the majority of code.

After the installation is complete its time to personalize a little as well as prepare for project work. I decided to save some time by preconfiguring Visual Studio by setting my development settings to C#.

I started by cloning the group repository from the start-up menu so that I have a way to contribute with the group on the project prepared for the future. The group provided a guide on how to better customise your git within Visual Studio but I decided against any changes and I had already implemented my git account details into Visual Studio.
I also personally decided to get the CSharpier extension from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csharpier.CSharpier&ssr=false#overview which will help auto-format my code.
This improves the quality and ensures that code is easier to understand for fellow team members.

This should have prepared me for collarborating now. But I still need to check .NET MAUI is installed and working correctly.



Since I already had Git but wanted to ensure I was using an up-to-date version with the rest of the group I redownloaded the installer from https://git-scm.com/download/win which automatically uninstalled my prexisting version and installed the newest one. Git has no install options for me to customise so it went as far as that.


The main requirements are to show that:

1. Your development environment is correctly set up
2. You understand the setup including potential alternative configuration settings

## Environment configuration

Here, you should include appropriate screenshots with additional commentary. 

**DO**

* Place your image files in the `images` folder
* Choose your screenshots carefully so that they communicate the appropriate information.
  Many screenshots with no clear purpose or with trivial differences are of little value.
* Provide <ins>descriptive</ins> commentary to explain why the screenshot is included. 
  what it shows and point out any particularly significant details.
* Modify your screenshots - for example, by adding arrows, outlines or other highlighting 
  techniques - to enhance their communication value.
* Remove unnecessary material from your screenshots such as toolbars, other windows and 
  computer desktop to eliminate distractions.
* Ensure that any important content is clearly legible. Pay particular attention to text
  size and image resolution.
* Use [numbered captions](https://towardsdev.com/3-ways-to-add-a-caption-to-an-image-using-markdown-f2ca30562be6) 
  as labels for images. Also, use the caption numbers to refer to images in your text.

**DON'T**

* Expect the reader to understand your reasons for including a screenshot. If you can't
  explain it, the screenshot will not do the job on its own.
* Include self-evident comments. For example, don't simply list the values used on a
  configuration page if those values are clearly visible in the screenshot.

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use sub-headings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.
